Question 3

Fixing the error-prone codes.

Below is the code (left) that is encrypted using a number. 
Once you decrypt the below code, it reveals the original code with many errors. 
Please fix them and explain them using comments (#).

To decrypt the above code, first, you need to understand how it is encrypted (above right image).
1.  Fixing the next code will reveal the key.
2.  Write the decryption function to decrypt the ‘encrypted code’ to the original code.
3.  Correct the errors and provide the comments.
4.  Should show everything in your program file.
