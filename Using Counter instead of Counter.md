Using Counter instead of Counter

From Gislene:

Instead of manually counting each word by looping through the list, You can use a built-in Python tool called Counter.
In finding the top 30 words you were manually finding the most common words one by one, 
which was slowing things down. I swapped that out for the function in Counter that directly gives the top 30 most common words. This way, we get the same result with less code and effort.
 
I added a little function to clean up the text before counnting the words. 
This makes sure everything is lowercase and removes any unwanted characters like hyphens or underscores.
 
To help you more, you can definitely find information about these commands on the official Python website.
