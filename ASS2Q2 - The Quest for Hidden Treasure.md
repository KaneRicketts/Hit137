Question 2
Here’s an adventurous story intertwined with Python programming questions that involve 
nested 'for' loops, conditional statements, string manipulations, and more.

The Quest for the Hidden Treasure:
Deep within the mystical lands of Pythoria lay the fabled Temple of Codes, 
rumored to house a treasure of knowledge guarded by enigmatic puzzles. 
The path is challenging, and only those who can do the coding will unravel the final word, 
leading to the treasure.

Chapter 1: The Gatekeeper
The above algorithm generates a number (n). 
You should use this number to change the pixels (r,g,b) in the provided image (Chapter1.png) 
by adding the original pixel values (r,g,b) with the generated number (Example: (r+n, g+n, b+n)).
Generate a new image with the converted pixels (upload it as ‘chapter1out.png’).
Finally, add all the red (r) pixel values in the new_image and provide the sum as output to move to the next chapter.

Chapter 2: The Chamber of Strings
Pt1.
Assume s is a string.
Write a program that separates a long string (at least length of 16)
that contains both numbers and letters (upper and lower case)
into two substrings of numbers and letters.
Convert the even numbers in "number substring"
and upper case letters in the "letter string"
into ASCII code decimal values.

Example Scenario:
String = "56aAww1984sktr235270aYmn145ss785fsq31D0"
Separate them: 561984235270145785310 (number string) and aAwwsktraYmnssfsqD (letter string)
Convert the even numbers in the number string to ASCII code decimal values:
6, 8, 4, 2, 2, 0, 4, 8, 0 (even numbers)
becomes 54, 56, 50, 50, 48, 52, 56, 48 (ASCII decimal values)

Convert the upper-case letters in the letter string to ASCII code decimal values:
A, Y, D (upper case letters)
becomes 65, 89, 68 (ASCII decimal values)

Pt2.
You are required to create a program that showcases the required output for the following question:
Many newspapers publish a cryptogram each day, for instance:
